# IndeedML

## Welcome

This mini-project was done to simply count word frequencies of categories such as programming languages and frameworks appearing in job postings related to machine learning/data science.

The code is rather simple and not optimized for parallelism, so it takes a couple of minutes for it to extract informations from 100 job postings. The following images represent the word frequencies in my defined dictionary based on the search query "machine learning" on Indeed.com.

By doing so, I was able to obtain some insight into the qualifications expected for a typical machine learning job.
